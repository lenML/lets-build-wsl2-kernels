This repository provides automated builds of Microsoft's official WSL2 kernel sources, compiling and releasing only the bzImage kernel files.

## Why This Exists ‚ùì

Microsoft maintains the [WSL2-Linux-Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel) but:
- Doesn't provide pre-built historical kernel versions
- Only distributes kernels through Windows Update
- Makes it difficult to test different kernel versions

I encountered issues while fine-tuning models using **Unsloth**, and I suspect they are related to the WSL2 kernel. To experiment with different WSL kernels, I created this repository.

The specific Unsloth issue can be found here: https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/issues/1744  
Problems I discovered include:

- Some WSL kernel versions have serious memory management issues:
  - Memory is requested but cannot be released, even when `pageReporting=true` is enabled.
  - `memlock` limits vary‚Äîsome WSL instances have a higher or even unlimited locked memory cap, but typically the limit is around 2GB. In my tests, it sometimes allows only 2GB, which is entirely dependent on the WSL kernel.
    - `memlock` has a hard limit that seems unchangeable within WSL.
    - `memlock` appears to overestimate current locked memory; repeated locking of the same memory can be counted multiple times.
- Some WSL kernels are incompatible with Docker Desktop.

This project:
- Automates building official Microsoft kernel sources exactly as released
- Provides access to historical kernel versions
- Only distributes the compiled bzImage (kernel binary)
- Does NOT provide or modify any vhdx files

## Features ‚ú®

- Builds any WSL2 kernel version from Microsoft's repository
- Manual trigger with version selection
- Weekly automatic builds of latest stable version
- Provides only the bzImage kernel file
- Clean builds with no modifications

## Download Pre-built Kernels

https://github.com/lenML/lets-build-wsl2-kernels/releases

## Usage üöÄ

### Manual Build via GitHub UI

1. Go to "Actions" tab
2. Select "Build WSL2 Kernel"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Specify kernel version (e.g. `5.15.90.1`)
5. Click "Run workflow"

### Install Compiled Kernel

1. Download the bzImage artifact after build completes
2. Place it in your preferred location (e.g. `C:\Windows\System32\lxss\tools`)
3. Create/modify `%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig`:

```ini
[wsl2]
kernel=C:\\path\\to\\bzImage
```

4. Restart WSL: `wsl --shutdown`

### Local Build

To build locally from official sources:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh [version]
```

Example:
```bash
./scripts/build.sh 5.15.90.1
```

## Supported Versions üì¶

All versions from Microsoft's [WSL2-Linux-Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel/tags) can be built.
