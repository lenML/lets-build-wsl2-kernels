This repository provides automated builds of Microsoft's official WSL2 kernel sources, compiling and releasing only the bzImage kernel files.

## Features ‚ú®

- Automates building official Microsoft kernel sources exactly as released
- Provides access to historical kernel versions
- Only distributes the compiled bzImage (kernel binary)
- Does NOT provide or modify any vhdx files

## Download Pre-built Kernels

https://github.com/lenML/lets-build-wsl2-kernels/releases

## Usage üöÄ

### Manual Build via GitHub UI

1. Go to "Actions" tab
2. Select "Build WSL2 Kernel"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Specify kernel version (e.g. `5.15.90.1`)
5. Click "Run workflow"

### Install Compiled Kernel

1. Download the bzImage artifact after build completes
2. Place it in your preferred location (e.g. `C:\Windows\System32\lxss\tools`)
3. Create/modify `%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig`:

```ini
[wsl2]
kernel=C:\\path\\to\\bzImage
```

4. Restart WSL: `wsl --shutdown`

### Local Build

To build locally from official sources:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh [version]
```

Example:
```bash
./scripts/build.sh 5.15.90.1
```

## Why This Exists ‚ùì

Microsoft maintains the [WSL2-Linux-Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel) but:
- Doesn't provide pre-built historical kernel versions
- Only distributes kernels through Windows Update
- Makes it difficult to test different kernel versions

I encountered issues while fine-tuning models using **Unsloth**, and I suspect they are related to the WSL2 kernel. To experiment with different WSL kernels, I created this repository.

The specific Unsloth issue can be found here: https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth/issues/1744  
Problems I discovered include:

- Some WSL kernel versions have serious memory management issues:
  - Memory is requested but cannot be released, even when `pageReporting=true` is enabled.
  - `memlock` limits vary‚Äîsome WSL instances have a higher or even unlimited locked memory cap, but typically the limit is around 2GB. In my tests, it sometimes allows only 2GB, which is entirely dependent on the WSL kernel.
    - `memlock` has a hard limit that seems unchangeable within WSL.
    - `memlock` appears to overestimate current locked memory; repeated locking of the same memory can be counted multiple times (as documented in [WSL's infiniband/user_verbs.rst](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel/blob/main/Documentation/infiniband/user_verbs.rst#memory-pinning)).
- Some WSL kernels are incompatible with Docker Desktop.

## Memory Management in WSL Kernels

The WSL2 kernel has specific behaviors around memory allocation and locking:

1. **Performance Monitoring Memory**: 
   - The `perf_event_mlock_kb` setting governs memory available for performance monitoring
   - This extends the `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` limit but only for perf_event mmap buffers
   - Processes with `CAP_IPC_LOCK` capability bypass these limits
   - [See documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel/blob/main/Documentation/admin-guide/perf-security.rst#memory-allocation)

2. **Memory Pinning**:
   - Direct I/O requires memory regions to stay at fixed physical addresses
   - The kernel accounts pinned memory in `pinned_vm`
   - Pages pinned multiple times are counted each time (may overestimate actual usage)
   - [Documentation reference](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel/blob/main/Documentation/infiniband/user_verbs.rst#memory-pinning)

These behaviors explain some of the memory management challenges encountered when running memory-intensive workloads in WSL2.
